    Suppose you are designing a multiplayer game that has n ≥ 1000 players, numbered 1 to n, interacting in an enchanted forest. The winner of this game is the first player who can meet all the other players at least once (ties are allowed). Assuming that there is a method meet(i, j), which is called each time a player i meets a player j (with i 6= j), describe a way to keep track of the pairs of meeting players and who is the winner.
لنفترض أنك تصمم لعبة متعددة اللاعبين تحتوي على n ≥ 1000 لاعب ، مرقمة من 1 إلى n ، تتفاعل في غابة مسحورة. الفائز في هذه اللعبة هو أول لاعب يمكنه مقابلة جميع اللاعبين الآخرين مرة واحدة على الأقل (يسمح بالروابط). بافتراض أن هناك طريقة لقاء (i ، j) ، والتي تسمى في كل مرة يلتقي فيها اللاعب i باللاعب j (مع i 6 = j) ، صف طريقة لتتبع أزواج اللاعبين الذين التقوا ومن هو الفائز.


To keep track of the pairs of meeting players and determine the winner in the multiplayer game, you can use a combination of data structures and algorithms. Here's one possible approach:

1. Create a data structure to represent the players and their meeting status. You can use an array or a list of player objects, where each object contains information about the player's ID, meeting status, and a list to track the players they have met.

2. Initialize the data structure with the number of players `n` and set the meeting status of all players to false.

3. Implement the `meet(i, j)` method. When player `i` meets player `j`, you can update their meeting status and add each other to their respective lists of met players.

   ````java
   void meet(int i, int j) {
       // Update meeting status
       players[i].setMeetingStatus(true);
       players[j].setMeetingStatus(true);

       // Add each other to the list of met players
       players[i].addMetPlayer(j);
       players[j].addMetPlayer(i);
   }
   ```

4. After each meeting, you can check if any player has met all the other players. Iterate through the player objects and check if the number of met players for each player is equal to `n - 1`. If you find such a player, they are the winner.

   ````java
   int findWinner() {
       for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
           if (players[i].getMetPlayers().size() == n - 1) {
               return i; // Player i is the winner
           }
       }

       return -1; // No winner found yet
   }
   ```

5. Start the game by calling the `meet(i, j)` method whenever two players meet. Keep track of the winner by calling the `findWinner()` method after each meeting.

Here's an example implementation of the player class:

```java
class Player {
    private int id;
    private boolean meetingStatus;
    private List<Integer> metPlayers;

    public Player(int id) {
        this.id = id;
        this.meetingStatus = false;
        this.metPlayers = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public boolean getMeetingStatus() {
        return meetingStatus;
    }

    public void setMeetingStatus(boolean status) {
        meetingStatus = status;
    }

    public List<Integer> getMetPlayers() {
        return metPlayers;
    }

    public void addMetPlayer(int playerId) {
        metPlayers.add(playerId);
    }
}
```

With this approach, you can keep track of the pairs of meeting players and determine the
 winner efficiently as the game progresses.
