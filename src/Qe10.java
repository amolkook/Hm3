    generator given on page 113 of this chapter such that the result
    is not very random looking, for n = 1000.
    For the first run of the program:

a = 153
b = 271
For the second run of the program:

a = 487
b = 619
For subsequent runs, you can continue changing the values of a and b
to get different sequences.
